    <h1>The ECMAScript specification is a standardized specification of a scripting language developed by Brendan 
        Eich of Netscape; initially named Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript. In December 1995, Sun Microsystems 
        and Netscape announced JavaScript in a press release. In November 1996, Netscape announced a meeting of the Ecma International 
        standards organization to advance the standardization of JavaScript. The first edition of ECMA-262 was adopted by the Ecma General 
        Assembly in 
        June 1997. Several editions of the language standard have been published since then. </h1>

    <h2>Ecma's Technical Committee 39 (TC39) is responsible for the maintenance of ECMAScript.
         New proposals to the language go through a staged process, with each stage representing the completeness of the proposal's 
         specification. Consensus must be reached within the committee to advance a proposal to the next stage. Proposals that reach stage 4, 
         the final stage, will be included into the next version of the standard.
         Since the release of version 6 in June 2015, new major versions have been finalized and published every June</h2>
